Quick Connect
About
Quick Connect is a networking app that simplifies professional connections by replacing physical business cards with digital ones. It offers fast, reliable access to contact information while prioritizing the safety and protection of your personal data.

Features
QR Code Scanning: Connect instantly by scanning another user’s QR code to view their public profile information. You can then send a connection request, and upon acceptance, you’ll have access to their full digital business card.

Nearby Users: Discover potential connections nearby based on geolocation. This is especially useful for meeting individuals within the same city or at events.

Status
Quick Connect is currently in production and will soon be available for Android and iOS platforms.
