<h3>Quick Connect is a networking app that simplifes the way we network by replacing physical business cards for digital ones. 
Allowing quick and reliable access while also ensuring safety and protection of your personal data</h3>

<p>Users can connect with each other through a multitude of ways. The easiest is through scanning 
another user's qrcode, thus gaining access to their profile and only viewing information they've made public.<p>

<p>The other option is by finding a connection through the nearby users feature. Which filters users
based off of their geolocation. This maybe useful for users within the same city or event looking to meet like-minded individuals.<p>
